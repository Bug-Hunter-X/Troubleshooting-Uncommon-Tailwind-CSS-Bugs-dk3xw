```javascript
// Example using Tailwind CSS classes
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">This is a title</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-600">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

The error: The styles are not applied correctly, or they are not applied at all. 

Possible reasons:

1. **Missing or incorrect Tailwind directives:** Make sure you have correctly configured the Tailwind CSS directives in your project. For example, in a `tailwind.config.js` file, you might include a `content` option that points to your HTML, CSS or JSX files in which you are using Tailwind classes: 
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx}", ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

2. **Incorrect class names:** Double check you have typed the Tailwind class names correctly.

3. **CSS specificity issues:** If you have conflicting CSS rules, those other rules may override the Tailwind styles.

4. **Build process issues:** For frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby or Nuxt.js, ensure that your build process correctly integrates Tailwind CSS (often through plugins).

5. **Missing or incorrect PurgeCSS (or similar) configuration:**  If you are using PurgeCSS or a similar tool to remove unused CSS, make sure it's configured correctly to include the necessary CSS from your Tailwind CSS setup.

6. **Typographical errors in class names:** This leads to Tailwind classes being rendered as regular classes.

7. **Incorrect import:** Make sure you have imported Tailwind CSS correctly into your project.

8. **Caching issues:** Sometimes, browser or build tool caches can cause issues. Try clearing your browser's cache and restarting your build process.

9. **Conflicting libraries:** Certain libraries or plugins can conflict with Tailwind CSS. Experiment with disabling non-essential plugins or libraries.
